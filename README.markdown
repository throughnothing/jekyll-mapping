# Jekyll Mapping

Jekyll mapping is a plugin for Jekyll that lets you easily embed Google and OpenStreetMap maps on your content, and then easily add markers and/or KML overlays to those maps.

## Supported providers

### Google static image

    mapping:
        provider: google_static

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/

Embeds a static image, centered on the specificed location, with a marker at the specified location

### Google JS API

    mapping:
        provider: google_js

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/

Embeds an interactive map using the V3 JS API. Using this requires an API key to be specified within _config.yml

### OpenStreetMap

    mapping:
        provider: openstreetmap

Uses [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [OpenLayers](http://openlayers.org/) to provide interactive maps. Doesn't require an API key.

## Configuration

To use, include configuration information in _config.yml. At minimum, specify a provider:

    mapping:
        provider: google_static

If desired, set default dimensions for maps and a custom zoom level (the default zoom level is 10):

    mapping:
        provider: openstreetmap
        zoom: 8
        dimensions:
            width: 600
            height: 400

If using Google JS API, include an API key:

    mapping:
        provider: google_js
        api_key: 123456
        zoom: 10
        dimensions:
            width: 600
            height: 400

Put the contents of '_includes' in your '_includes' directory and the contents of '_plugins' in your '_plugins' directory (or just copy the directories if you don't have those directories yet).

Set the relevant values in the YAML front matter of pages and posts:

    mapping:
        latitude: 51.101
        longitude: 0.1

Include the render_map tag in your templates where you'd like the map to appear:

    {% render_map %}

Optionally, specify the width for the map here:
    
    {% render_map 500,500 %}

Include the required JavaScript at the foot of your templates:

    {% include jekyll_mapping %}
    </body>

You don't need to wrap the above in any if statements - jekyll-mapping won't output anything if the page doesn't have both a latitude and longitude set.

Enjoy!

## Further usage

At it's most basic, you can just set a latitude and longitude for a piece of content. In this case, it'll just plot that location on a map. However, you can do some other exciting things too!

If you set multiple locations, they'll all be mapped and the map will be zoomed and panned to fit them. Do it like so:

    mapping:
        locations:
            - title: foo
              latitude: 10
              longitude: 10
            - title: bar
              latitude: -10
              longitude: -10

If you'd like to use KML, you can do that too. Just add 'layers' in a similar fashion:

    mapping:
        layers:
            - http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?g=322338@N20&lang=en-us&format=feed-georss
            - http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ggeoxml/cta.kml

Optional you can override the track colors (only for openstreetmap):

    mapping:
        layercolors: 0000CD FFA500
        layers:
            - http://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/geo/?g=322338@N20&lang=en-us&format=feed-georss
            - http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ggeoxml/cta.kml

Right now, multiple locations works for both google_js and openstreetmap. KML definitely works for google_js and should work for openstreetmap, but needs more testing.

## Future things to do

* Allow for custom markers to be set (both for the site as a whole and for specific pieces of content)
* More mapping providers (Bing?)
* More flexibility (allow specific zoom levels to be set for individual content items, if desired)
* Any more ideas? Please suggest them.
